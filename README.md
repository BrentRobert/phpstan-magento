# bitexpert/phpstan-magento

This package provides some additional features for PHPStan to make it
work for Magento 2 projects.

## Installation

The preferred way of installing `bitexpert/phpstan-magento` is through Composer.
You can add `bitexpert/phpstan-magento` as a dev dependency, as follows:

```
composer.phar require --dev bitexpert/phpstan-magento
```

Include extension.neon in your project's PHPStan config:

```
includes:
	- vendor/bitexpert/phpstan-magento/extension.neon
```

## Known Issues

Below is a list of known issues when using this extension:

### PHPStan shim does not generate factories, proxies, etc.

This is because the PHPStan shim is included as a phar archive and does therefore not support overriding certain methods in it's namespace. The current known fix for this is to manually load the autoloader that comes with this extension.

Create a file in your project (for example `phpstan.php`) with the following content:

```php
<?php
\bitExpert\PHPStan\Magento\Autoload\Autoloader::register();
```

Include this to the `autoload_files`-section of your `phpstan.neon`:

```neon
parameters:
    autoload_files:
        - phpstan.php
```
